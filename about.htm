<p> There are over 700 large and small fountains in Munich, more than 180 of which are municipally-owned. <br>These are not just water bodies, but also small oases of refreshment on hot days. <br>You can let your hands briefly dangle in the Richard-Strauss-Brunnen and the Fischbrunnen or feel the splash from Stachusbrunnen on your face. <br>It is gloriously cooling. Some daredevils even run straight through the Stachus fountain. <br>The Neptune Fountain or the Wittelsbacher Fountain are also wonderful sights to behold.</p>

   and the Ruhmeshalle, and the buildings at Konigsplatz all the way to the Siegestor. As soon as it gets dark, the lights turn on and these Munich landmarks shine in all their glory. On mild summer nights, a stroll through the city reveals surprises of a completely different nature. Don't forget your camera! The best option is to look for one of the many scenic observation points and enjoy the view of the radiant city from above.</p>
    
<li> <h3>Fun swimming in open-air pools</h3></li>
<p> Grab your towel, don't forget to apply sunscreen and we're off to the open-air pool! The SWM pools lets you relax in the sun, swim lengths, dive for rings and splash around playfully until mid-September. Every pool is different but unique in their own rights! From diving platforms and long slides to underwater bubble massages - there are things to do in Munich for anyone who loves the water. If you're not in the playful mood, there are sunbathing areas at every pool for relaxing and browsing through your phone or favorite book. </p>
<li><h3> Displays and fresh air</h3></li>

<p> Who wants to sit inside when, even at night, it's well over 20 degrees outside? Several open-air cinemas in Munich screen current blockbusters and classic films. With great entertainment like this, mild summer evenings seem to fly by. Other events such as the impark summer festival , Tollwood in Olympiapark or the classical-music concert at Odeonsplatz will entice you out and into nature. You can also take part in sports with professional instruction at Fit im Park.</p>
    
<li><h3>Picnics and relaxation in the parks</h3></li>
    
<p> Though the Englischer Garten is Munich's most visited park in summer, but Westpark, Luitpoldpark and Ostpark also have a lot to offer. These are some places you can spread your picnic blanket and enjoy the summer weather. The extensive park facilities at the castles are also perfect for long, rambling walks. Nymphenburger Park is another sight that awaits with its fairy-tale brook, sculptures and fountains.</p>
    
<li><h3>Sunbathing at Isar River</h3></li>
<p> The recreational value of the Isar is tremendous. The paths along the river are popular with joggers and walkers; dog owners use riverside forests and tracks for rambling walks with their pets. In summer you don't really need much more than a bikini, a blanket and a shady spot. Between the two bridges - Cornelius and Wittelsbacher - is the most lively spot, but there are also quieter areas along the banks. In some places, like Flaucher, you can also have a barbecue.</p>
<li><h3> Sipping a coffee in the sidewalk cafes</h3></li>
  
<p> There's a reason Munich is described as the 'northernmost city in Italy': Numerous sidewalk cafes line the streets and you can sit outside in the sun, almost anywhere. Some have tables on the pavement; others even have a couch to relax on or deckchairs in the sand. While you enjoy an iced coffee with vanilla ice cream, cappuccino or espresso, you can also observe the vibrant atmosphere of the city.</p>
    
<li><h3> Absolutely idyllic - Munich's lakes</h3></li>

</p> Numerous lakes await sun-seeking swimmers in the Munich metropolitan region. Many of them, like Lerchenauersee and Fasaneriesee or Feldmochinger See, are easy to get to by bicycle and are even well-connected through public transport. The MVG Badebus ('swimming bus') drives to Langwiedersee and Lubsee in the hot summer months. Outside of the city as well, beautiful stretches of water like Feringasee or Poschinger Weiher are quite accessible. So don't make excuses - head off to the lake!</p>

<li><h3> Tour the Botanical Gardens</h3></li>
<p>  Botanical Gardens are usually open all year round, but in summer they reveal their full magnificence. This is when the shrubs and flowerbeds overflow with the splendor of flowers and birds, wild bees and frogs start to appear. In high season, approximately 14,000 different plant species grow here. If you are one of those who find it too warm to marvel at the sea of â€‹â€‹flowers out in the sun, you can simply go in search of shady trees in the arboretum.</p>
<li><h3>A cool beer under the chestnut trees</h3></li>
<p> A toast to cosy refreshment! Munich's beer gardens attract many locals and tourists alike in summer. Sitting with a cool beer under shady chestnut trees is a great way to deal with the summer heat. It's the perfect combination for enjoying the beautiful weather and refreshing yourself. If you like to drink your beer by the water, you can pop into the Michaeligarten, the Seehaus garden or the 'Zum Flaucher' beer garden. Then again, other traditional taverns offer live music from proper brass bands.</p>
